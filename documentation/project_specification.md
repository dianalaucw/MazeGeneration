Project Specification
---
This project aim to evaluate and compare the performance of various maze generating algorithm, including Prim's algorithm (Tree based),Wilson's algorithm(Tree based), Sidewinder algorithm(Set based), Eller's algorithm (Set based)

Data structures and algorithms
---
Prim's algorithm create a minimum spanning tree. Wilson's algorithm create unbiased uniform spanning tree using random walk. Sidewinder algorithm is similar to binary tree algorithm, which generate row by row, creating a binary tree at the end. Eller's algorithm also create the maze row by row, with cells in each row stored in a set.

Input/Output
---
Output is a perfect maze without any loops or closed circuits, and without any inaccessible areas. The Maze has one solution only and can be considered as a spanning tree over a set of cells or vertices.
