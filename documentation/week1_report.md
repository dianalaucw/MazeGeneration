# Week 1 report

I have finished most of the part in the project definition, chose the theme as the comparison of various maze generating algorithm and did some research on the topics. I learnt some basic concepts behind maze generation i.e. creating a minimum spanning tree using DFS or utilize a set to generate maze row by row.

Determining the space complexity is a bit confusing for me but I guess it would be more clear after actual implementation of the algorithms.

Next week hopefully I can start the Java coding part and see what problems will arise in real implementation.
